          <p class="involvement"><span>Involvement: </span><br/>Front-end Development</p>
          <p><span>Info: </span><br/>EE shop project was a huge peice of work with well over 50 people working on the development of this one site. Using design/brand guidlines and a extensive UX library my job was to join a large group of developers in building the EE shop pages. The whole site was developed so it met accessibility standards and was fluidly responsive accross all browsers and modern devices. The responsive framework was one devleoped by Orange/EE and followed a 12 column grid system.<br/><br/>My duties on the project included creating pages and templates to fit with the UX/designs and implementing them within the responsive framework. Doing this required Javascript & Jquery skills along with the ability to use other standard front-end languages such as HTML5 & CSS3, SASS. The project was all hosted on Git and being able to efficiently use feature branches which working alongside a big team all developing on similar modules was very important.<br/><br/> At later stages of the project my role also incuded a lot of bug testing and development on legacy browser such as I.E 8, along with fully implementing accessibility requirements to custom javascript functions so they could be operational with just keyboard. Using assistive text techinques to make the website fully readable for screen readers also required a lot of work.<br/><br/> This project ran well over 6 months but was challenging and incredibly interesting to work on something of such a large scale.</p>
